          <h2>CDR Report Review</h2>
          <p>
            Our team of specialists spend a considerable time reviewing your
            report. We review it with the high standards we have maintained. We
            check the CDR report for plagiarism with our advanced softwares. We
            edit it ensuring that all the necessary documents and details have
            been laid out. We proofread it several times so that not a single
            mistake, not even a minor typo, escapes our notice. And of course,
            we add finishing touches at the end. Only after rigorous checking,
            we deem it fit for submission.
          </p>
          <p>
            CDR Writing is not as easy as it sounds. Its technicality and
            procedures can be quite overwhelming. Our team of engineering
            experts and professional writers will navigate you through ANZSCO
            Codes, RPL samples, Career Episodes, CDR samples and more so that
            the documents you present are stronger and free of error. This will
            increase your chances of favourable skills assessment and,
            subsequently, approval. You bet, we prepare and deliver perfect
            CDRs.
          </p>
          <h2>Editing and Proofreading</h2>
          <p>
            Are you worried you don’t have pristine language skills? (Heck, we
            can’t acquire excellent English overnight.) Our package includes
            superb editing and proofreading services. It will make you more
            confident to submit your CDR to Engineers Australia. We don’t just
            check your spellings and grammar, we pick out factual errors,
            mistaken structures, and anything that doesn’t comply with their
            guidelines. Even if your English is mediocre, we will help you
            produce a professional sounding document for this Australian skill
            assessment, bolstering your chances of migration to Australia.
          </p>
          <p>
            CDR reviewing, with its many edits and proofreads, is an art in
            itself; that too an art we excel in. A CDR that is not polished is
            often the reason for rejection of CDRs. Our seasoned writers, in
            almost every engineering discipline, will provide you constructive
            feedback when it comes to writing Career Episodes and getting the
            reports just right. They also give you heads up if there’s anything
            in the report that goes against Australian sensibilities and hurts
            your chances. They will work on your CDR report over and over again
            until it is EA-ready.
          </p>
          <h2>Plagiarism Checking and Removal Service</h2>
          <p>
            Have you come across a beautifully written sentence in a report
            while researching? Were you unable to suppress the urge to simply
            copy paste it? We have all been there. Engineers Australia uses the
            state-of-the-art tools and softwares when it comes to checking for
            plagiarism. They are extremely strict about plagiarism. Resorting to
            plagiarism demonstrates the applicant’s lack of ethics. Who knows
            what he/she will steal next? So, our experts detect plagiarism in
            your report before they do, sparing you a year of being banned by
            the Engineers Australia.
          </p>
          <p>
            Of course, the Assessor cannot go through tons of unnecessary
            details. We will help you stick to the word limit ensuring that
            nothing important is left out. Your CDR Summary Statement is the
            first place an assessor reviews, and your Summary Statement is
            determined from your overall report, so your report must be written
            in your own words using your original ideas. Any ideas or sentences
            you have borrowed must be referenced, or else it will be counted as
            literary theft. After you submit a draft of your completed report,
            our experts will inspect it for any trace of plagiarism and even run
            it through advanced tools and software. They will provide you with a
            list of sentences which have been found to be plagiarised. It gives
            you a chance to alter them before you submit your report. Plagiarism
            check and removal is extremely important when it comes to writing a
            successful CDR.

                  There are certain rules in EA about CDR writing. Many
                  qualified and experienced engineers get rejected in CDR
                  assessment. Engineers Australia rejects your CDR if your CDR
                  isn’t written as per their requirements. But there is no need
                  to panic after rejection, using our CDR review services will
                  help you to pass the cdr assessment on the second attempt.

                  Skills assessments are issued by relevant skills assessment
                  authorities. A skills assessment authority is an organization
                  that verifies your abilities and confirms if they meet their
                  requirement to work in a relevant occupation. In simple words,
                  assessment of an individual’s ability to perform specific jobs
                  is skills assessment.

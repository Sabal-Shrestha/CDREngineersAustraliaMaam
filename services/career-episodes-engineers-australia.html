                  Writing Career Episodes can be quite challenging. That’s where
                  you might need an expert’s help. We specialise in creating
                  Career Episode, Summary Statements, RPL Report Writing, KA02
                  and all the necessary components of CDR. Our team of
                  professional writers will take you through the writing
                  process. Our writers will have detailed conversations with you
                  to guide you through. Your writing must be original as
                  Engineers Australia will reject any plagiarised Career
                  Episode. With our help, you will be aware about the format and
                  can avoid formatting errors.

                <h2>Why do you need a career episode?</h2>
                <p>
                  Career Episodes are an important part of CDR Report Writing
                  and are required to demonstrate your engineering knowledge to
                  determine if you have the Stage 1 competencies by Engineers
                  Australia’s standards. You are required to write three career
                  episodes. Each career episode must describe your overall
                  project, the part you played in it, your contribution to it,
                  and what competencies it shows.
                </p>
                <p>
                  It can be used to demonstrate an array of competencies for
                  your occupational categories. Photographs, tables, graphs, and
                  diagrams only will not be enough to prove that you have the
                  Stage 1 competencies.

                  Career Episode Report not only showcases your ability to Stage
                  1 competency but also displays your communication skills to
                  Engineers Australia. Each Career Episode must be based on a
                  project or any work that you have worked or are working on. It
                  must contain details about the problems you have solved by
                  applying your engineering expertise, and the experiences you
                  have gained from it. There are four categories under which you
                  can apply for Skilled Migration. They are:

            alt=""
          />
          <p>A Career Episode is structured as such:</p>
          <h3>1. Introduction</h3>
          <p>
            The word limit for the introduction is around 100 words. It should
            include information such as the date and the period of the project,
            the location, the name of the organization and your designation in
            the project.
          </p>
          <h3>2. Background</h3>
          <p>
            Your background must be limited to 200-500 words. It should
            delineate the context in which your project was based on. It must
            include the concept of the engineering project, the project’s
            objective, the area of work, and what your responsibilities were in
            the project.
          </p>
          <h3>3. Personal Engineering Activity</h3>
          <p>
            It must be written in around 500-1000 words. It is the body of a
            Career Episode. The candidate gets to describe the project in full
            detail. You can show your achievements in the project. If a group is
            involved, the Assessor focuses more on your specific role and
            participation in the group instead of the overall activities of the
            group. You must remember that your engineering capabilities are
            being examined. It all boils down to how you used your engineering
            expertise to handle the project. You must explain the project
            assigned to you and how you managed it. You can also include the
            technical hiccups encountered and how you solved them. You can talk
            about any innovative ideas you provided. If it was a group project,
            you can include how you coordinated with your team members in this
            section.
          </p>
          <h3>4. Summary</h3>
          <p>
            The CDR Summary Statement needs to be concise, only around 50-100
            words. It wraps up the Career Episode with your views on the
            engineering project and your role in it. It can talk about how the
            tasks help achieve the goals. It needs to highlight succinctly once
            more how you contributed to the project.

              <h2>Topics for Career Episode writing</h2>
              <p>
                It’s wise to be careful while choosing the topic for your Career
                Episodes. It should be something that interests you, and
                something with which you can show the extent of your expertise.
                You have to write three Career Episodes and you must choose the
                topics that place you at an advantage. You can base your Career
                Episodes on any engineering project that you were involved in.
                It could also be a workshop or tech fests you had participated
                in. You must have worked on an engineering project at the
                beginning of your career that too could be used. You might have
                dealt with some innovative designs that could also be included.
                Do not forget to mention your designation in the group projects
                or in the workplace you had been working in. It lends more
                credence to your projects and hints at your professionalism.

          <h2>Tips Before You Get Down to Career Episode Report Writing</h2>
          <p>Here are some helpful tips for you for writing Career Episode:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>You can speak in the first person (“I…”).</li>
            <li>The word limit is between 1000 and 2500.</li>
            <li>Number each Career Episode and even each paragraph.</li>
            <li>
              Include your role in the project and highlight them as this is
              what the assessor checks.
            </li>
            <li>Include technical details wherever necessary.</li>
            <li>Provide only relevant data.</li>
            <li>
              Do not write separately about each element of competency. But
              don’t feel you have to display all the elements of competency. But
              do try to get as many competencies as possible in your Career
              Episode.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            After completing your Career Episodes and finalising your report,
            you must then conduct a CDR Report Review before sending it to EA.

                  A Career Episode is a component of CDR. It is more like an
                  essay but is technical. In it, engineers can demonstrate their
                  knowledge and skills of their respective engineering field. It
                  can also be used to showcase the engineer’s language skills.
                  It should focus on a particular project or incident. You must
                  elaborate on the project to prove that the engineer can show
                  the competencies required by the Engineers Australia. It is
                  further used in Summary Statement to link indicators and
                  elements. Your Career Episodes must be carefully written
                  keeping in mind that you have to make it easier for yourself
                  to write the Summary Statement by presenting relevant
                  information only and organizing it well.

                  A career episode is basically a very technical essay. Here are
                  some tips to write it:
                </p>
                <ul>
                  <li>Every paragraph needs to be numbered.</li>
                  <li>Write using the first person pronoun (I…).</li>
                  <li>
                    Check the list of competencies required by the Engineers
                    Australia to know which project to choose for your Career
                    Episode. It also helps you to know what details to include
                    and which ones to remove as they must be in line with the
                    guidelines of Engineers Australia.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    It must have more than 1500 words and less than 2000 words.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Include your role and achievements on each of the projects.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Explain in detail about the engineering problems you came
                    across and your role in solving them.

                  There must be three Career Episodes in your CDR report. They
                  must be based on three projects you had completed in
                  university or while working professionally as an engineer. It
                  must be used to prove that you have Stage 1 competencies.
